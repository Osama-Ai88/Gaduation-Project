# Gaduation-Project
This graduation project focuses on implementing and evaluating three popular recommendation algorithms:
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Apriori, and Collaborative Filtering. These algorithms help users find relevant items
based on their preferences, increasing customer satisfaction. KNN provides personalized recommendations by
finding the closest item to the user based on their choices. Apriori identifies frequently occurring items for
targeted discounts or promotions. Collaborative Filtering ranks items based on preferences of similar users,
offering high-ranking recommendations.
